# Power BI Report (PBIR) Skill

This skill provides guidance on how to develop Power BI reports using the PBIR (Power BI Report) JSON file format.

## Critical

- Schema‑aware: validate JSON against the declared `$schema`; call out violations and propose fixes.
- Understand the [PBIP file structure](../powerbi-semantic-model/references/pbip.md).

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **powerbi-semantic-model**: Use for semantic model development (tables, measures, DAX). This skill (`powerbi-pbir`) handles report layout, visuals, and pages only.
- **powerbi-tmdl**: Use for TMDL syntax when working with semantic model definition files.
- **fabric-cli**: Use for workspace operations, deploying, and exporting report definitions.

## Pre-development: Understand the Report

Before making any changes to an existing report, always gather context first:

1. **Verify PBIR format** — Confirm the report has a `definition/` folder with `report.json`, `pages/`, and `version.json`.
2. **List all pages** — Read `pages/pages.json` to understand the page structure and order.
3. **List visuals per page** — For each page, list the visual folders and read each `visual.json` to understand visual types, positions, and field mappings.
4. **Identify the semantic model** — Read `definition.pbir` to understand which semantic model the report is connected to (`byPath` or `byConnection`).
5. **Check theme and resources** — Review `StaticResources/RegisteredResources/` for custom themes and images.

## PBIR file format

Example of a report folder using `PBIR` format:

```text
Report/
├── StaticResources/ # stores report resources such as images, custom themes,... 
│   ├── RegisteredResources/
│   │   ├── logo.jpg
│   │   ├── CustomTheme4437032645752863.json
├── definition/ # stores the entire report definition: pages, visuals, bookmarks
│   ├── bookmarks/
│   │   ├── Bookmark7c19b7211ada7de10c30.bookmark.json
│   │   ├── bookmarks.json
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── 61481e08c8c340011ce0/
│   │   │   ├── visuals/
│   │   │   │   ├── 3852e5607b224b8ebd1a/
│   │   │   │   │   ├── visual.json
│   │   │   │   │   ├── mobile.json
│   │   │   │   ├── 7df3763f63115a096029/
│   │   │   │   │   ├── visual.json
│   │   │   ├── page.json
│   │   ├── pages.json
│   ├── version.json
│   ├── report.json
├── semanticModelDiagramLayout.json # Copy of the semantic model diagram layout the report is connected to.
└── definition.pbir # Overall definition of the report and core settings. Also holds the reference to the semantic model of the report, it's possible to rebind the report to a different semantic model by updating this file.
```

## Name property

All report objects have a `name` property. For example see the `visual.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/fabric/item/report/definition/visualContainer/2.1.0/schema.json",
  "name": "5868707ac858bcbe007a",
  "position": {
    "x": 32.118081180811807,
    "y": 216.32472324723247,
    "z": 4000,
    "height": 492.16236162361622,
    "width": 366.52398523985238,
    "tabOrder": 2000
  },
  "visual": {
    "visualType": "barChart",
    "drillFilterOtherVisuals": true
  }
}
```

By default PBIR folder uses the internal `name` property of pages, visuals and bookmarks in the files or folders. For example consider the following path of a visual:

  `Sales.Report\definition\pages\89a9619c7025093ade1c\visuals\5acb1caf298449a8acb4\visual.json`

  `89a9619c7025093ade1c` is the name of the page and `5acb1caf298449a8acb4` the name of the visual.

## Task: Create new report on top of semantic model

1. **Understand the semantic model** — Before creating any report, ensure you have a good understanding of the semantic model: its tables, key measures, dimensions, and date/calendar table.
2. **Create or reuse PBIP folder** — Create a new PBIP report folder structure or reuse an existing one. Follow the [PBIP structure](../powerbi-semantic-model/references/pbip.md).
3. **Copy template files** — Copy `assets/templateReport/report/definition` and `assets/templateReport/report/StaticResources` to the `*.Report` folder.
4. **Configure the semantic model reference** — Update `definition.pbir` to point to the target semantic model (use `byPath` for local, `byConnection` for workspace).
5. **Adapt visuals to the semantic model** — Load [template-report-kb.md](assets/templateReport/template-report-kb.md) and follow its instructions to map each visual to the semantic model fields (title, topCard, dateSlicer, barChart, timeSeries).
6. **Validate** — Run the [Post-development validation](#post-development-validate-changes) steps.

## Task: Edit an existing report

Use this workflow when the user wants to add/modify/remove visuals, pages, or bookmarks in an existing report.

1. **Locate the report** — Determine source (PBIP folder or export from workspace) and access the PBIR files.
2. **Run Pre-development discovery** — Follow the [Pre-development](#pre-development-understand-the-report) steps to understand the current report structure.
3. **Plan changes** — Based on the user request, identify which files need to be created, edited, or removed.
4. **Execute changes** — Apply modifications:
   - If adding visuals: create a new folder under the page's `visuals/` directory with a `visual.json` file. Use the correct `$schema` and set appropriate `position`, `visual.visualType`, and field mappings.
   - If editing visuals: modify the `visual.json` — update field mappings, position, or visual type.
   - If adding pages: create a new page folder under `pages/`, add a `page.json`, and update `pages/pages.json` with the new page entry.
   - If removing objects: delete the folder/file and update parent index files (e.g., `pages.json`, `bookmarks.json`).
5. **Validate** — Run the [Post-development validation](#post-development-validate-changes) steps.

## Task: Align Power BI Report visuals

1. **Verify PBIR format** — Confirm there is a `definition/` folder with the report pages.
2. **For each page**, perform the following:
   1. **Inspect all visual.json files** — Read the `position` property of each visual (`x`, `y`, `height`, `width`, `z`, `tabOrder`) and take into consideration the page dimensions (default 1280x720) in `page.json` to understand the current layout and identify misalignments or overlaps.
   2. **Build a wireframe** — Map out each visual's X/Y position and dimensions to understand the current layout.
   3. **Infer the layout grid** — Identify rows and columns in the current arrangement. Group visuals into rows and columns based on similar `y` (for rows) and `x` (for columns) values.    
   4. **Apply consistent alignment:**
      - Ensure horizontal and vertical distribution is even across rows and columns.
      - If a row has only one visual, expand its width to fill the row.
      - When possible, make all visuals in the same row have the same height and width.
   5. **Update position values** — Edit each `visual.json` with the corrected `position` properties.

## Task: Rename folders to improve readability

1. **Identify target objects** — The internal `name` property is used by default in folder and file names. You can rename folders for: pages, visuals, and bookmarks.
2. **Rename the folder** — Change the folder name to a human-readable name (e.g., `mainPage`, `salesBarChart`, `dateFilter`).
3. **Verify references** — Ensure no other files reference the old folder name (internal `name` property in JSON files remains unchanged — only the folder name changes).

## Task: Export a report from Workspace

1. **Create folder structure** — Set up the PBIP folder structure following the [PBIP guidelines](../powerbi-semantic-model/references/pbip.md).
2. **Export using Fabric CLI** — Use the `fabric-cli` skill to export the report code definition from the workspace.
3. **Place files correctly** — Ensure the exported definition goes into the `[Name].Report/definition/` local folder.
4. **Verify** — Confirm the exported folder contains `report.json`, `version.json`, and `pages/` with at least one page.

## Task: Import/Deploy a report to a Workspace

1. **Update `definition.pbir`** — **CRITICAL:** When deploying a report to a workspace, the `definition.pbir` must use a `byConnection` configuration targeting a workspace semantic model:

    ```json
    {  
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/fabric/item/report/definitionProperties/2.0.0/schema.json",
      "version": "4.0",
      "datasetReference": {
        "byConnection": {      
          "connectionString": "semanticmodelid=[SemanticModelId]"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Deploy using Fabric CLI** — Use the `fabric-cli` skill to deploy. You can deploy with a new name if needed.
3. **Verify deployment** — Confirm the report appears in the target workspace and opens correctly.

## Task: Rebind Power BI Report to a different semantic model

### Target is a local PBIP folder

1. **Edit `definition.pbir`** — Configure a `byPath` property using a relative reference to the semantic model folder:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/fabric/item/report/definitionProperties/2.0.0/schema.json",
      "version": "4.0",
      "datasetReference": {
        "byPath": {
          "path": "../Sales.SemanticModel"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Verify field references** — After rebinding, check that visual field mappings (`Entity` and `Property` references in `visual.json` files) are still valid against the new semantic model.

### Target is in a Fabric workspace

1. **Find the semantic model ID** — Use Fabric CLI or workspace API to locate the target semantic model ID.
2. **Edit `definition.pbir`** — Configure a `byConnection` property targeting the semantic model ID:

    ```json
    {  
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/fabric/item/report/definitionProperties/2.0.0/schema.json",
      "version": "4.0",
      "datasetReference": {
        "byConnection": {      
          "connectionString": "semanticmodelid=[SemanticModelId]"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Verify field references** — Ensure visual field mappings are compatible with the new semantic model.

## Post-development: Validate Changes

After any report modification, always verify your work:

1. **Validate JSON schemas** — Ensure all edited JSON files are valid against their declared `$schema` URL.
2. **Check visual field mappings** — Verify that `Entity` (table name) and `Property` (column/measure name) references in `visual.json` files match the connected semantic model.
3. **Verify page index** — Confirm `pages/pages.json` lists all page folders and the order is correct.
4. **Check visual positions** — Ensure no overlapping visuals and that positions make sense within the page dimensions.
5. **Validate `definition.pbir`** — Confirm the semantic model reference (`byPath` or `byConnection`) is correctly configured.

## Task: Analyze report against best practices

Run the script `scripts/bpa.ps1` against the report definition. If no specific BPA rules are mentioned, use the default set of rules in `scripts/bpa-rules-report.json`.

1. **Run BPA** — Execute the Best Practice Analysis script:

    ```powershell
    scripts/bpa.ps1 -reports [path to the report definition folder] -rulesFilePath [path to the BPA rules json file]
    ```

2. **Report findings** — Categorize results by severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Info) and propose fixes.

## Error Handling

- **Invalid JSON schema**: Read the `$schema` URL, validate the file structure against it, and fix any missing or extra properties.
- **Broken field references**: If a visual references a table or column that doesn't exist in the semantic model, update the `Entity` and `Property` values to match valid semantic model objects.
- **Deployment failure**: Verify that `definition.pbir` uses `byConnection` (not `byPath`) when deploying to a workspace. Check that the semantic model ID is correct.
- **Missing pages or visuals after export**: Verify the export completed fully. Re-export if the `pages/` folder is missing subfolders.
- **Template adaptation issues**: If the template report visuals don't render correctly, verify that field mappings use exact table and measure names from the semantic model (case-sensitive).
